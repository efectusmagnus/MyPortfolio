# julys-portfolio
The aim of this project is to make a mockup of pdf and add some changes. This includes a logo, four photos, text-styling and text.  

The photos were all optimized with Adobe Photoshop. The text uses hyphenization. There is a couple of code that seems repetitive, but they are necessary for diferent browsers. It is commented in css, anyway. There is only a JavaScript animation, and it is for the bottom of the text box to show or hide. I made it because I thought  the users of mobil devices would have to scroll a lot to see the portfolio's projects.
